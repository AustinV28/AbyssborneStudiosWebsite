## Abyssborne Gameplay Preview

The trailer shows actual gameplay as the player maneuvers through collapsing platforms, evades deadly spike traps, and performs fast-paced jumps. Every element is designed to challenge reflexes while immersing players in a haunting pixel-art atmosphere. There's no UI clutter — just pure platforming focused on rhythm, movement, and survival.

## Introduction

Abyssborne is a 2D pixel-art obstacle course game developed by four student creators with a passion for retro aesthetics and challenging gameplay. Built in Unity, Abyssborne drops players into a dark abyss full of death-defying jumps, collapsing floors, and spike-laden platforms. The goal is simple — survive the descent. But in practice, it’s anything but easy.

Our vision was to create an experience that is intense, skill-based, and stylistically rich. In this project, we brought that vision to life, combining hand-drawn pixel assets with Unity’s physics system to build a complete, playable vertical platformer.

## Design and Illustrations

The game’s world features a vertically descending structure built with shadowy pixel tiles, glowing spikes, and environmental elements that evoke an abandoned, cursed place. The player sprite is minimal but expressive, paired with snappy jump animations and sound effects to enhance feedback.

The background, UI overlays, and tilemaps were hand-crafted and intentionally limited in palette to maintain a cohesive dark-abyss aesthetic. Abyssborne borrows inspiration from classic 16-bit games but grounds itself with modern level design principles.

Our ultimate goal is to polish Abyssborne into a publishable indie game built on the foundation of our teamwork, creativity, and shared vision.
