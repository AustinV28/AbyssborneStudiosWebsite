# The game's future

Even though Abyssborne was made for a class project, there’s still a lot we want to do with it. One idea is to add more levels or floors that each look different and include new mechanics, like moving traps or wind. We also talked about adding powerups like double jump or wall slides to give the player more control. It would be cool to add bosses or timed challenges, and maybe even a story or lore told through the background. If we had more time, we’d probably make a multiplayer race mode too where players compete to survive the fall. There’s a lot of ways to expand it, and this project was just the starting point.
