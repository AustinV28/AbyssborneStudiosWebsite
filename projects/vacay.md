## Core Mechanics

From playing and testing the game, I’d say the mechanics are all about timing and movement. You have to jump across platforms that collapse, avoid spikes, and make sure not to fall off. There’s no combat or story — just movement and survival. The fun part is how fast everything happens. You don’t always get to see what’s coming next, so it teaches you to react on the spot. We designed it this way on purpose to keep the player thinking and to make every attempt feel a little different. Even though the controls are simple, staying alive takes some skill.
