Abyssborne is a 2D pixel-art obstacle game where the main goal is to survive while falling deeper into an abyss. You control a small character who has to jump, time, and react quickly as platforms fall apart and traps appear without warning. The style is simple but dark, and the game focuses on platforming over everything else. What makes it fun is how it starts off pretty chill but slowly becomes more intense the further you go. As a group, we wanted to create something that looked clean but also gave players a bit of a challenge without making it too complicated.
