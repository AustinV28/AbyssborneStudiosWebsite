summary: "This section explains the visual design choices and the audio atmosphere we used in the game. It focuses on how we kept the pixel-art style simple but effective, and how the Floor 1 background audio sets the mood without being too distracting."

Abyssborne uses a pixel-art style with darker tones and a limited color palette to give it that moody, abyss-like vibe. The floors are made up of blocky platforms and sharp spikes, while the background stays simple and quiet. We didn’t want to make the visuals too loud or distracting, so we focused on making everything readable but still creepy. The player sprite is small and easy to follow, and the traps stand out enough to give the player time to react.

For the audio, we wanted to match the visuals and create a kind of eerie atmosphere. We didn’t use music for every floor, but for Floor 1, we added a background track that feels a little tense but not overwhelming. It’s there to set the mood without getting in the way of the gameplay.

Here’s the audio we used for Floor 1:
